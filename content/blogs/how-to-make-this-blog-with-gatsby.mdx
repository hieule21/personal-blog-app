Hi guys! Gatsby offers really cool features, when it comes to build blazing fast static sites. In other words, Gatsby is a static site generator, powered by ReactJS, GraphQL, Webpack, ES6 Javascript and CSS.
It make it easier to build and maintain our sites, if we follow Gatsby project structure.

In this blog, we'll go through Gatsby's fundamental concepts, as well as the roles of technologies that are mentioned in this project.

## Prerequisite

Please ensure you know the following:

- NodeJS and NPM
- HTML, CSS and ES6 Javascript
- Basic understanding of ReactJS

## What is a static site ?

It is the fixed webpage displaying the same content if requested. For that reason, there is no querying database related and no dynamically display data from the database.
Static sites are suitable for creating blogs, marketing posts, portfolio, etc.

## How does Gatsby work ?

Gatsby recieves data from any data sources such as Markdown files or data from database (without dynamic updates). Gatsby then uses GraphQL to query the data and render out with the help of ReactJS, HTML, and CSS.
