Hi guys! Gatsby offers really cool features, when it comes to build blazing fast static sites. In other words, Gatsby is a static site generator,
powered by ReactJS, GraphQL, Webpack, ES6 Javascript and CSS.It make it easier to build and maintain our sites, if we follow Gatsby project structure.

In this blog, we'll go through Gatsby's fundamental concepts, as well as the roles of technologies that are mentioned in this project.

## Prerequisite

Please ensure you know the following:

- NodeJS and NPM
- HTML, CSS and ES6 Javascript
- Basic understanding of ReactJS

## What is a static site ?

It is the fixed webpage displaying the same content if requested. For that reason, there is no querying database related and no dynamically
display data from the database. Static sites are suitable for creating blogs, marketing posts, portfolio, etc.

## How does Gatsby work ?

Gatsby recieves data from any data sources such as Markdown files or data from database (without dynamic updates). Gatsby then uses GraphQL
to query the data and render out with the help of ReactJS, HTML, and CSS.

## Preparation

+ Install the Gatsby CLI

   ```shell
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

+ Create a new Gatsby project

   ```shell
   gatsby new gatsby-blog
   ```

+ Run the app

   ```shell
   gatsby develop
   ```

Now, let's open the browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000) and everything seems ready for
us to create a blog!

Looking at the folder we've got, it is a usual react-app folder, except for a few additional files from gatsby in the root directory:

- gatsby-browser.js - Implement Gatsby's Browser APIs in this file
- gatsby-config.js - Add plugins in this file
- gatsby-node.js - Implement Gatsby's Node APIs in this file.
- gatsby-ssr.js - Implement Gatsby's SSR (Server Side Rendering) APIs in this file.

These are four important files that defines how our app works and Gatsby will look for during its build time. We'll be
using mostly **_gatsby-config.js_** and **_gatsby-node.js_**.

## Modify the app

1. #### Create a first blog post:

   + Create a new folder and name it **_blogs_** in the root directory. This is where we create and store our blog posts.
   + Create a file named **_my-first-post.md_**. The file has two main parts:

     - Frontmatter: Add a frontmatter in the beginning of the file as information for this file.
       For example, the **path** field is used to create an url leading to that blog post page.
     - Content: Add blog post's content right after the frontmatter with Markdown syntax.
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: First blog
   description: This is my first blog
   path: /first-blog            
   date: 2020-06-18
   ---

   The blog content goes here
   ``` 

   + Create a few more same-structure files, then we'll later render them out programmatically.


2. #### Apply neccessary plugins:
   + It's time to get our hands dirty with ***gatsby-plugin.js***. This is where we add plugins that extends Gatsby's abilities to
   get its job done.
   + As you may notice, there are a few plugins pre-added to our project, but let's just ignore them for now. 
   + Open ***gatsby-plugin.js*** and add this code under the __plugin__ array: 
   ```js
   {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
         name: `blogs`,
         path: `${__dirname}/blogs`,
      }
   }

   ```
   + The plugin __gatsby-source-filesystem__ is already installed by Gatsby CLI and helps Gatsby know where to find 
   the folder __blogs__.
   + To query all the **Markdown** files in GraphQL (more on this in the next section), we also need plugin __gatsby-transformer-remark__:  
   ```shell
   npm install gatsby-transformer-remark
   ```
   + Include the plugin we just installed in ***gatsby-plugin.js*** under the __plugin__ array as one of its elements: 
   ```js
   `gatsby-transformer-remark`
   ```
   ****Note***: Remember to restart development server (`gatsby develop`) after changing ***gatsby-plugin.js*** file.

3. #### Query static data by GraphQL in React components:
   + Open the browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql), you'll see GraphiQL, which
   is the GraphQL integrated development that helps us work with GraphQL easily.
   + There are three subwindows: 
      + Left subwindow - Explorer: This GUI allows us to query data by clicking on the fields we need.
      + Middle subwindow: Displaying what we chose on Explorer window in code format which is used to query data in React
      components.
      + Right subwindow: Queried data is shown here in Javascript object format.
   + In Explorer tab, two fields **allFile** and **file**, added by plugin __gatsby-source-filesystem__, allows us to get all
   the files which we added their directory to ***gatsby-plugin.js*** (included the blogs folder).
   + To query Markdown files, we should use plugin __gatsby-transformer-remark__, which adds two new fields ***allMarkdownRemark*** and ***markdownRemark***
   to Explorer tab.
